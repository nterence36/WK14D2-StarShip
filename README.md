/Week 14 - Day 2
Practice What You Learned
Intro
In the lesson earlier you:

Learned to consume a third-party API in React and invoke the call to that API using the useEffecthook.
Created a "service" module to organize fetchcalls within.
In this lab, you'll consume the Star Wars API and render it's data.

This lab is a DELIVERABLE




Set Up
To get set up for this lesson:

Use create-react-appto create a React app named react-star-wars
cdinto react-star-warsand open VS Code.
Open a terminal in VS Code.
Start the React Dev Server.



Exercises
Styling in this lab is secondary to completing the functionality

Research documentation of SWAPI to find the endpoint for the starshipsresource.
Create a services/sw-api.jsservice module and ensure that all API/fetch calls are made from this module.
Use named exports to expose AJAX functionality as needed, e.g., export function getAllStarships() {...}to obtain all starships.
Obtain all of the starships from the API and render in <App>a card for each starship.
Cards should contain the text of the starship's name.



For example:


Hints
Hold the starship objects in state with the useStatehook, don't forget to initialize to an empty array!
Use the useEffecthook to make the AJAX request once the app loads.
Once the starship data comes from the API, be sure to update state with the setter function.
Create and import a StarShipCardcomponent into App.js.
.map()over each starship object in state to transform them into a <StarshipCard />component
CORS issue? Try changing your /starshipsendpoint to /starships/👈 trust us on that one 😎.



Bonus
Display additional details for each Starship in it's respectable card.
This API has a pagination feature that allows you to get additional starships to display - find out how to use this to your advantage and allow users to get more starships at the click of a button
Here's an informative article on pagination
